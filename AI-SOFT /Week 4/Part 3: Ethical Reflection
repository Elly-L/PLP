The dataset may underrepresent certain patient demographics, leading to biased predictions in issue prioritization.
For instance, if most samples are from one hospital or demographic group, the model may overfit to that context.

Fairness Tools:
IBM’s AI Fairness 360 can assess metrics like Disparate Impact and Equal Opportunity Difference, identifying where the model favors specific groups.
Techniques like reweighing or bias mitigation algorithms can adjust model training to promote fairness, ensuring equitable resource allocation and trustworthy AI outcomes.
