#Manual Implementation
def sort_dict_list(data, key):
    return sorted(data, key=lambda x: x[key])

#AI-Suggested (GitHub Copilot)
def sort_dict_list(data, key):
    try:
        return sorted(data, key=lambda item: item.get(key, 0))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: {e}")
        return data
Analysis (200 words):
Copilot’s version adds error handling and uses .get() to avoid KeyError, making it slightly more robust.
However, the manual version is simpler and faster for controlled inputs.
Efficiency-wise, both have O(n log n) complexity, but the Copilot version adds minimal overhead for error catching.
AI-suggested code is more production-ready but may not always follow project style guides.
Hence, AI can accelerate boilerplate generation, but human review ensures correctness and performance optimization.
